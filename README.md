 # CSC2001F 2023 Assignment 5: Performance Comparison of Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
This assignment aims to programmatically compare the performance of Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm with its theoretical performance bounds. The assignment involves generating datasets, inserting the data into a graph, measuring performance, and reporting the results.

## Project Structure

### Directories
- `src/`: Contains all the source code.
- `bin/`: Contains all compiled class files.
- `doc/`: Contains the Javadoc documentation output.
- `data/`: Contains the data files generated by the program.
- `report.pdf`: The report detailing the experiment, results, and discussion.

### Files
- `Makefile`: Used for automation of compilation and documentation generation.

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the source code and generate the Javadoc documentation, run:
```sh
## How to run 
- make all
